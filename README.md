# ATTCKscraper
Scrapes ATT&amp;CK site for technique and returns desired info. I built this to make it easier to pull the data I wanted in the format I wanted from ATT&CK, since copy-pasting repeatedly from the browser kinda sucks...

## Current Status: Beta
The project is currently in a beta stage, so it currently has limited functionality. Feedback and pull requests appreciated!
