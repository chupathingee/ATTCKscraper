# ATTCKscraper
Scrapes ATT&CK site for technique and returns desired info. I built this to make it easier to pull the data I wanted in the format I wanted from ATT&CK, since copy-pasting repeatedly from the browser kinda sucks...

## Current Status: Beta
The project is currently in a beta stage, so it currently has limited functionality. Feedback and pull requests appreciated!

Walter, if you see this, sorry for shouting "Lee Holmes" and "I have your trivia answer" when you were trying to finish your talk, I was just really excited... Thanks for the prize and it was a pleasure to talk to you!
